  <h1>Traffic Light (Java)</h1>

  <p>Demonstrates how to to generate Java source code from a statechart. The
    procedure is explained in the documentation, section "Java code generator".
  </p>

  </p>

  <p>In summary, there are two traffic lights: one for the traffic on the street, and
    one for pedestrians who want to cross the street. They can push a button to
    request their traffic light to turn green, which activates a blinking
    wait-light first. The street's traffic light then goes through the standard
    procedure, turning on the yellow light, followed by the red light, allowing
    the pedestrians to cross safely. After some time, the pedestrians' traffic
    light turns red again, and the cars are allowed to pass until the next
    request is made by a pedestrian.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the traffic light can be switched off completely. This
    turns the yellow lights into a blinking mode, signaling that the traffic
    light is indeed switched off and that the street should be crossed in a
    careful manner.</p>
    
  <p>The traffic light example is based on Java and contains a small GUI 
that demonstrate the state machine behaviour in /model/TrafficLightCtrl.sct. 
This example combines generated Java code with manual Java implementations (the GUI). 
To generate the state machine code, right-click on /model/TrafficLightCtrl.sgen and select 
'Generate Code Artifacts'. To start the application run src/traffic/light/TrafficlightDemo.java. 
For this, just right-click on the project and select 'Run As > Java Application'.</p>

Please be aware of the following issues:

<ol>
<li>The example requires a JAVA 8 JDK.</li> 
<li>When you installed the example, Eclipse may show errors on the project. This 
is likely due to a missing configuration of the JDK. In this case select 'Properties'
from the project's context menu and set the correct JDK in 'Java Build Path'. You 
will find further help in the 'Java development user guide' section of the Eclipse help.</li>
</ol>
