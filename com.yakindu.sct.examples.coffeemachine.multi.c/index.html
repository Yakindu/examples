		<h1>[Pro] YAKINDU Coffee Machine with multiple state machines</h1>
		<p class="pro-feature">
			Statechart can get large and in these cases you may want to modularize the behavior and split it into two or more 
			separate but interacting state machines. Modularization of complex reactive behavior facilitates maintainability,
			reuse, and team work. This example shows how multiple interacting statecharts can be used to build an application. 
			It integrates the statechart on the level of the generated C code and thus makes use of the capabilities of the
			deep C integration.<br/>
			<br/> 
			The application example is the coffee machine that you may already know from our other example projects. 
			If you are not femiliar with the 'Deep C Integration' feature of the YAKINDU Statechart Tools then you may consider 
			to take a look at the '[Pro] Coffee Machine with C integration' first.<br/>
			<br/>
			In difference to the design of the original coffee maker statechart model the behavior of this example 
			is described by six statecharts. One statechart for the general functions of the coffee maker like handling user input,
			power save mode, or executing selected recipes. The other five statecharts define the processing for each recipe as an 
			independent statechart.</p>

		<p>	There are five statcharts that define the processing of the different recipes that the coffe maker provides. Thus these are named 
			<i>ProcessCappucino</i>, <i>ProcessCoffee</i> etc.. Based on the user input the main statecahrt <i>CoffeeMachine</i> selects  
			one of the recipe processing state machines. Interacting with these state machines is possible by directly accessing the generated
			state machine C API. For the example we choose a more generic approach. The <i>sc_statemachine</i> module defines a generic state machine
			wrapper. Instances of this wrapper refer to state machine and provides general functions to enter, exit, and execute the wrapped state 
			machine. Thus using the wrapper the main state machine just has a dependency on the wrapper and no direct dependency on the different 
			the different recipe state machines. </p>

		<p> So lets take a look how the coffee machine model is defined. Most things happen in the state <i>Process Recipe</i>. 
			When this state is entered, the statchart gets a recipe processing state machine from the array <i>recipeProcessors</i> using an index  
			which is based on the user input. This array is an array of state machine wrappers (<i>sc_statemachine_t</i>). At that point the 
			selected state machine is used as a sub state machine of the <i>Process Recipe</i> state. This is done by assigning the selected recipe machine
			to the <i>recipeProc</i> state machine pointer variable and directly activating it by calling the 
			<i>sc_enter</i> function. As the state machine has cycle based execution semantics the recipe state machine is directly executed with 
			each cycle using the <i>always / sc_runCycle(recipeProc)</i> local reaction. When the recipe processing has completed it enters a final state. 
			The <i>Process Recipe</i> state is then exited and also an exit is called on the recipe processing machine.</p>

		<h3>Prerequisits to run the example</h3>
		<p>	The example is implemented as a simple command line tool. It makes use of POSIX threads. So you
			need a compiler tool chain and a 'pthread' library to build an run the example. 
		</p>
		<h3>Manually written source code</h3>
		<p>
			The source code artifacts are all located in the 'src' folder. File names that include 'coffee' or 'cm_'
			include application specific implementations and those with 'sc_' prefix are generic parts that
			belong to the state machine infrastructure. This also includes state machine wrapper that is defined in 
			the 'sc_statemachine' module. If you want rto use this in your project then simply copy it. 
		</p>
		<h3>Set up your system</h3>
		<p>
			As mentioned above you need a compiler tool chain and the 'pthread'
			libraries.
			If you have a Linux or Mac OS Xsystem you likely have
			everything installed. If you run Windows than we propose to install
			cygwin tools (https://www.cygwin.com).</p>
		<h3>Set up the roject</h3>
		<p>
			This project is preconfigured for Windows with cygwin. If you use
			another system:
			<ul>
				<li>right-click on project 'coffee_machine' in the 'Project
					Explorer'</li>
				<li>choose 'Properties'	</li>
				<li>a dialog appears - choose 'C/C++ Build'</li>
				<li>select 'Tool Chain Editor'</li>
				<li>choose the appropriate tool chain for 'current tool chain'</li>
				<li>click 'OK'</li>
			</ul>
			... and your project should be ready to build.
		</p>
		<h3>Build</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Right-click on project 'coffee_machine' in the 'Project
					Explorer'</li>
				<li>choose 'Build Project'</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Run the example</h3>
		<p>
			In the 'Debug' or 'Release' folder you will find an executable
			'coffee_machine_pro.exe'
			(even on Linux and Mac OS X). Right-click on
			this and choose:
			<ul>
				<li>'Run As > Local C/C++ Application'.</li>
			</ul>
			The embedded Eclipse console shows up and you can follow the
			instructions. Enter
			'o' to start the coffee machine...
