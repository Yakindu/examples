    <h1>Zowi (C++)</h1>
    <p>
      This is a example of how to use the C/C++ Domain together with the Zowi by BQ, which is based on an Arduino Uno. C++ Timer are integrated. </p>

    <p>The statechart contains four states. Firstly, the zowi will be initialized. After this Zowi is awake and tries to walk a circle. If maximum is reached he will wait for some noise. If something in his way he will detect it and stop walking. The underlying statechart looks like follows:</p>

    <h2>Addons for compiling and flashing</h2>
    <p>For compiling and flashing the Eclipse C++ IDE for Arduino plugin has been used. This can be found at 'https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-c-ide-arduino'. Please ensure that you have installed the Arduino toolchain/AVRDude. This can easily be done by installing the Arduino IDE.</p>
  	<h3>How to install the Eclipse C++ IDE for Arduino plugin</h3>
  	<p>
  	This instructions shows step by step of how to install the plugin.</p>
  	 <ol>
      <li>Click on 'Help' -> 'Install New Software..' -> 'Add...'.</li>
      <li>Define a name and add 'http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/9.3' as location. Notice that this update site could be outdated. The current update site can be found on the marketplace.</li>
   	  <li>Use the filter and type 'Arduino C++ Tools'. Choose this feature and click on 'Next..'. Follow installation instructions.</li>
   	  <li>The installation dialog will ask you for a restart. After this restart is done, the installition has been finished.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Download the required platform and libraries</h2>
    <p> At first the required platform and libraries have to be installed: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Click on 'Help' ->'Arduino Download Manager'.</li>
      <li>In the 'Platforms' tab, install the 'arduino' package. In this example version 1.6.23 has been used.</li>
      <li>In the 'Libraries' tab, install the 'Servo' library. In this example version 1.1.3 has been used.</li>
    </ol>
   <h2>Add the required platform and libraries</h2>
    <p>Then it's required to add the required libraries to the project</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Right click the Zowi example propject and click on 'Properties'.</li>
      <li>Open the libraries tab and add 'Servo' and 'EEPROM'. This is shown on the following figure: </li>
<p>  <img
        alt="ZowiStatechart"
        src="images/ZowiLibraries.png" /></p>
    </ol>
   <h2>Compile and flash</h2>
    <p>At least the 'Launch Configuration' needs to be configured:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Plug in the Zowi and click on 'New Launch Target..'.</li>
      <li>Name: Choose a name</li>
      <li>Port: Choose the port</li>
      <li>Board Type: Arduino/Genuino Uno</li>
      <li>Programmer: AVR ISP</li>
    </ol>
      <p>After this you can build and run the project!</p>
