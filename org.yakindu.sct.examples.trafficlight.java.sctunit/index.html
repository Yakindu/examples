  <h1>Traffic Light (Java) with SCTUnit</h1>

  <p>This example demonstrates how a SCTUnit Test File could look like and how you can execute them to verify that a statechart model works correctly.

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
  This project builds up on the Traffic Light example for Java. The SCTUnit File in the folder 'tests' tests the function and logic of the statechart.
  To run the Test, right click on the File and Select 'Run As -> SCT Unit'. The JUnit view will open and you will see the results.
  In the package 'traffic.light.tests' in the folder 'src-gen' is also a JUnit Test which was generated from the SCTUnit File.
  </p>

  <p>To sum up the statechart model: There are two traffic lights: one for the traffic on the street, and
    one for pedestrians who want to cross the street. They can push a button to
    request their traffic light to turn green, which activates a blinking
    wait-light first. The street's traffic light then goes through the standard
    procedure, turning on the yellow light, followed by the red light, allowing
    the pedestrians to cross safely. After some time, the pedestrians' traffic
    light turns red again, and the cars are allowed to pass until the next
    request is made by a pedestrian.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the traffic light can be switched off completely. This
    turns the yellow lights into a blinking mode, signaling that the traffic
    light is indeed switched off and that the street should be crossed in a
    careful manner.</p>

  <h2>Known issues</h2>
  <p>

<ol>
<li>The example requires a JAVA 8 JDK.</li> 
<li>When you installed the example, Eclipse may show errors on the project. This 
is likely due to a missing configuration of the JDK. In this case select 'Properties'
from the project's context menu and set the correct JDK in 'Java Build Path'. You 
will find further help in the 'Java development user guide' section of the Eclipse help.</li>
<li> For the generated Java Tests you will need JUnit 4 (simply configure in 'Java Build Path' and add the JUnit library to the build path) and <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-all/2.0.2-beta">Mockito 2.0.2</a> (download it and add it as library to the Java Build Path, by right-click on the project -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries -> Add External JARs...)</li>
