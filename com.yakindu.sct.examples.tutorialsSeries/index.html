To the right you see a very simple Statemachine Diagram. It consists of an Entry Point (black circle), a State called 'StateA' and a transition from the entry to StateA (the arrow).
</p><p>
Your first task is to add a new 'StateB' and then connect 'StateA' to 'StateB' with a transition.
</p><p>
To do this simply drag and drop a new state from the palette on the right in to the main region and name it afterwards. 
</p><p>
In order to connect the states, click on transition in the palette, then click on StateA, keep your mouse button pressed and draw the arrow from StateA to StateB.
</p><p>
Now you need to add a transition description, which we call trigger. Type 'after 3s' into the transition textbox. If you don't see any textbox. Doublick the black arrowhead to make it appear.
</p><p>
Your last task is to create another transition that leads back from StateB to StateA, the trigger is again 'after 3s'. You should now have a small circual statemachine.
</p><p>
If you want to compare your first steps with the sample solution you can look it up under the 'Sample Solution' Folder on the left side of the screen.
