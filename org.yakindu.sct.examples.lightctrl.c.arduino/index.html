    <h1>Basic Finite State Machine for Arduino</h1>

    <p>A very basic example for the Arduino platform that switches an LED on
      and off.</p>

    <p>
      This example was used in an article on the website <a
        href="http://www.instructables.com/">instructables.com</a>. You can read
      the article <a
        href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Finite-State-Machine-on-an-Arduino/">here</a>.
      It demonstrates how to get started with YAKINDU Statechart Tools and the
      Arduino platform and contains a timer service for the Arduino. You need to
      have an Arduino plugin, as described in the example "Arduino traffic
      light" and in the linked article.
