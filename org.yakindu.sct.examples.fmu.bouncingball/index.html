		<h1>FMU Code Generation</h1>

		<p>This example demonstrates how to generate a FMU from a statechart. For this we will use the example of a bouncing ball and calculate the height of the ball over time with the statechart.</p>

		<h2>Generator Model</h2>
		<p>
			In order to generate code we need to specify which code generator to use and into which folder to generate. For this, we need to create a so-called generator model, which is already done for this project. To do so by yourself, 
			<ul>
				<li>Select the models folder in the <em>Project Explorer</em></li>
				<li>Right-click and choose <em>New -> Code generator model</em></li>
				<li>Follow the wizard to select the FMU code generator and the state machine for which you want to generate the FMU</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			The new generator model will look similar to this one:
		</p>
		<p>
			<script src="https://gist-it.appspot.com/github/Yakindu/examples/blob/release4/org.yakindu.sct.examples.fmu.bouncingball/models/BouncingBall.sgen"></script>
		</p>
		<p>
			The generator model defines where the code should be generated into by specifying the target project and target folders.

		<h2>Invoking Code Generation</h2>
		<p>
			Code generation is usually invoked each time the statechart model is saved. This behavior can be disabled by unchecking the option <em>Project -> Build Automatically</em>. You can always manually invoke the code generation with <em>Generate Code Artifacts</em> in the context menu of the generator model.
		</p>

		<h2>The Example Application</h2>
		<p>
			As an example application we will use the 'BouncingBall' statechart to calculate the height of a ball which is dropped to the ground and then continues to bounce until a certain point in time.
		</p>
		<img class="large" 
		alt="Bouncing ball model" title="Bouncing ball model" border="0" src="images/model.png"/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Our statechart determines the height of the ball by taking the velocity of the ball and the gravitation into consideration. Also, with every bounce to the ground the velocity of the ball is reduced by a constant factor.
