    <h1>Traffic Light (C) for Arduino</h1>

    <p>Based on the standard traffic light example, this project shows how
      to use a statechart to develop software for the Arduino platform.</p>

    <p>
      <img class="large" alt="The statechart"
        src="images/TrafficLightCtrl.png" />
    </p>

    <p>More information about the statechart itself can be found in the
      standard traffic light example, which should be considered first. In
      summary, we have two traffic lights: one for the traffic on the street,
      and one for pedestrians who want to cross the street. They can push a
      button to request their traffic light to turn green, which activates a
      blinking wait-light first. The street's traffic light then goes through
      the standard procedure, turning on the yellow light, followed by the red
      light, allowing the pedestrians to cross safely. After some time, the
      pedestrians' traffic light turns red again, and the cars are allowed to
      pass until the next request is made by a pedestrian.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the traffic light can be switched off completely. This
      turns the yellow lights into a blinking mode, signaling that the traffic
      light is indeed switched off and that the street should be crossed in a
      careful manner.</p>

      <h2>Installing the Arduino Plugin</h2>

      <p>To compile the generated C code for Arduino, you should install an
        Eclipse plugin that can handle this and provides the needed libraries.
        In this example we're using the Sloeber plugin. 
        On Windows, you should also install the regular Arduino IDE, because
        Windows is lacking the drivers to use the Arduino without Arduino IDE.</p>

        <p> 
        	The easiest way to install the plugin is using the example wizard.
        	Select the 'Traffic Light (C) for Arduino' example, click on 
        	'Install Dependencies...' and follow the instructions.
        	Your IDE may restart. SCT will
        	restart and download the necessary Arduino libraries for you.
        </p>
        	Another way is using the update side, which can be found at <a 
        	href="http://eclipse.baeyens.it/">http://eclipse.baeyens.it/</a>. In
        	YAKINDU SCT, simply install it by selecting <em>Help → Install New
        	Software</em> in the main menu, typing or pasting
        	<code>http://eclipse.baeyens.it/update/V4/stable</code>
        	into the proper field, and follow the regular procedure. SCT will
        	restart and download the necessary Arduino libraries for you.

      <h2>Building the Hardware</h2>

      <p>
        <img class="small" alt="The circuit needed for the project"
          src="images/screenshot_installhardware.png" />
      </p>

      <p>Get your parts ready! You will need:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>2 push buttons</li>
        <li>6 LEDs, ideally:
          <ul>
            <li>2x red</li>
            <li>2x green</li>
            <li>1x yellow</li>
            <li>1x white</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>8 resistors:
          <ul>
            <li>2x 10kR or similar</li>
            <li>6x 220R or similar</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Of course you can change the pins, but since this represents the
        pin numbers in the software, don't forget to change them as well.</p>

      <h2>Building the Project</h2>

      <p>
        With this example being active in your workspace, with the Arduino
        plugin installed, the Arduino connected, and the correct port set in <em>Project
          → Properties → Arduino</em>, you can now build the example and upload it to
        your Arduino. Also, ensure you have selected the correct arduino and toolchain path.
        Before building the project, you have to generate the model code.
      </p>

      <p>You should have seen the new buttons in your SCT installation:</p>

      <p>
        <img class="inlinemediaobject" alt="Arduino plugin buttons"
          src="images/arduino_buttons.png" />
      </p>

      <p>Use the button second from the left to build and upload the code in
        one step.</p>
