  <h1>Custom Generator Example for SCXML</h1>

  <p>
    This example explains how to develop a custom code generator for the open
    source framework <a href="http://www.statecharts.org" target="_blank">YAKINDU
      Statechart Tools</a>. In this example, we will generate <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCXML" target="_blank">Statechart
      XML (SCXML)</a> from a simple stopwatch state machine. The stopwatch use case
    is taken from the <a
      href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-scxml/usecases/scxml-stopwatch.html">Apache
      Commons SCXML</a> site. The stopwatch model consists of four different states
    (<b>ready, running, stopped,</b> and <b>paused</b>) and the state
    transitions are triggered by events that represent the stopwatch buttons (<em>watch.start,
      watch.stop, watch.split, watch.unsplit, watch.reset</em>).

  <p>
    Note that this example is not a full-fletched Statechart XML code generator,
    only the basic concepts of <em>states, transitions</em> and <em>events</em>
    are supported to showcase how to get started. We expect the following XML
    fragment to be generated from the model above:
  </p>
  <pre id="xmlOutput" class="xml prettyprint"><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;scxml xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/07/scxml" version="1.0" initial="ready"&gt;
   &lt;state id="ready"&gt;
      &lt;transition event="watch.start" target="running" /&gt;
   &lt;/state&gt;
   &lt;state id="running"&gt;
      &lt;transition event="watch.split" target="paused" /&gt;
      &lt;transition event="watch.stop" target="stopped" /&gt;
   &lt;/state&gt;
   &lt;state id="paused"&gt;
      &lt;transition event="watch.stop" target="stopped" /&gt;
      &lt;transition event="watch.unsplit" target="running" /&gt;
   &lt;/state&gt;
   &lt;state id="stopped"&gt;
      &lt;transition event="watch.reset" target="ready" /&gt;
   &lt;/state&gt;
&lt;/scxml&gt;</code></pre>
  <h2>SExec and SGraph meta models</h2>
  <p>
    Before starting with a code generator, we have to decide which of the two
    available meta models is most suitable for the use case. In model driven
    software development, a model always conforms to another model commonly
    referred to as a meta model. This meta model defines the building blocks a
    model can consist of. When developing a generator for YAKINDU SCT you can
    choose between two different meta models, <em>Sgraph</em> and <em>SExec</em>.
    In broad terms, <em>SGraph</em> represents the structure of the modeled
    statemachine (<em>States, Transitions, Events</em>) while <em>SExec </em>contains
    sequences that encapsulates our execution semantics (for example <em>Checks,
      Calls and Stateswitch</em>).
  </p>
  <p>
    The SGraph meta model is similar to the state machine meta model known from
    the UML. We have a top level element <em>Statechart</em> that contains a set
    of <em>States</em> and <em>Transitions</em>. <em>Transitions </em>may have
    events and a source and a target <em>State</em>. The following shows a very
    simplified version of SGraph.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="http://info.itemis.com/hubfs/blog-files/sgraph.png"
      alt="sgraph.png" width="373" height="241">
  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast, the SExec meta model defines an <em>ExecutionFlow </em>that
    contains a set of <em>ExecutionStates</em>. Every ExecutionState has an
    entry and an exit sequence of different <em>Steps</em>. Each Step can be of
    a different type, for example a <em>StateSwitch</em> or a <em>Check</em>.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to generate code for a runtime environment that somehow
    interprets a statechart structure (for example SCXML or <a
      href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-statemachine/">Spring
      Statemachine</a>) you should pick SGraph meta model. If you want to generate a
    code-only approach for another programming language and you want to ensure
    that it behaves exactly in the way all the other code generators behave you
    should pick the SExec meta model.
  </p>
  <h2>The sample Statechart XML generator</h2>
  <p>
    Creating custom code generators is really easy, it is a first-level concept
    in YAKINDU Statechart Tools. You can develop them directly within your
    project workspace. This is pretty awesome - adoptions to the model or the
    generator templates are executed instantly and you don't have to bother with
    long code-compile-test cycles. More information about how to setup a new
    code generator project is out of the scope of this blog post and can be
    found <a
      href="https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/statechart-tools/documentation/user-guide/#custom-code-generators">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When choosing the language for developing a new generator, you should
    consider using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/">Xtend</a> instead of
    Java. The syntax is familiar for every Java developer, but it adds some nice
    features like <a
      href="https://eclipse.org/xtend/documentation/203_xtend_expressions.html#templates">template
      expressions</a> and <a
      href="http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation/202_xtend_classes_members.html#polymorphic-dispatch">dispatch
      methods</a> that are really useful for developing code generators.
  </p>
  <p>The example Statechart XML generator implemented with Xtend could look
    like this:</p>
  <script
    src="https://gist.github.com/andreasmuelder/ca415996d7ef3af1a3c9ad3e9423defd.js"></script>
  <p>
    The <em>SCXMLGenerator</em> class implements the <em>ISGraphGenerator</em>
    interface. This interface defines which meta model will be used
    for the code generator. If you want to implement a code generator based on
    the ExecutionFlow meta model you would implement <em>IExecutionFlowGenerator</em>
    interface instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    The generate function uses Xtends template string to generate the
    scxml header. Most of the text ist static except the value for the initial
    attribute â€“ this is calculated in the initialState function. After
    the scxml header, the <em>generate</em> function for the head region
    (parallel regions are not implemented) is called. This function
     simply iterates over all states in this region and calls the
    generate function for states . Other vertex types, for example <em>Histories</em>,
    <em>Synchronizations</em> or<em> Final States</em> are filtered out. Last,
    the generate function for states creates a new XML element and iterates over
    all outgoing transitions to generate the nested transition element.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can download the complete generator project form our new <a
      href="https://github.com/Yakindu/examples">examples repository</a>. If you
    want to run the generated SCXML you could for example use the apache
    commons-scxml interpreter.
