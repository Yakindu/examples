		<h1>Debug and remote control state machines using YET</h1>

			The YAKINDU Execution Trace (YET) infrastructure supports interoperability between 
			state machines running in a target application and the YAKINDU tooling. 
			It supports model-level debugging and testing of the state machines based on execution traces. 
			This example shows how to remote debug a compiled state machine step by step. Please refer to the 
			<a href="https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/documentation/user-guide/yakindu_execution_tracing">YET documentation</a> for more information.

		<h2>ESP32 blinky LED example</h2>
		<p>
			This is a simple blinky LED example, which uses two states. The user can switch between the <i>Idle</i> and <i>Blink</i> by setting the toggle event.
			Once the Blink state is active, the state machine toggles between the <i>Off</i> and <i>On</i> state. By setting the delay variable, the time for the after
			trigger can be changed.
		</p>

		<p>
			This state machine is executed within an interactive application. This application can be used 
			from the command line. It reads user input from the standard input and writes to the standard output.
			It is build to run on a Raspberry PI. The SCT Simulation can be executed on any other machine. 
			For this setup both are located the same local network.
		</p>
			
		<h2>Building, flashing and running the application</h2>
		The project requires the <a href="https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/README.md">Espressif IDF Eclipse Plugin</a>. Just follow the detailed instructions. If you've already installed the required dependencies
		using our example wizard, you can start skip the first part and start with <a href="https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/README.md#installing-esp-idf-tools">Installing ESP-IDF Tools</a>.
		<p>
			The instructions contain detailed explanations of how to set up the environment, compile the program and flash the binary on the ESP32. It also shows how a terminal can be added. Your WiFi access can be set in the sdkconfig file. If you're running the application via UDP you must set the IP of the machine, which runs the debug SCT YET session: <br>
			<code>#define SCT_IP "Add your IP here"</code>
		</p>


		<h2>Debugging the statemachine trace</h2>
		<p>
			Debugging a statechart YET trace is simple. Within a statechart editor or on the model file entry 
			in the project explorer choose <i>Run As > Statechart Trace Debugging</i> from the context menu. 
		</p>

		<img class= "small" alt="Starting a trace debug session" src="images/runas.png" />
		
		<p>
			This will launch the trace debugger and by default will try to read the input of socket 4444, which is defined in the application.
			You can change the port in the <i>Run Configuration</i>.

		</p>
		<h2>Installing YET support</h2>
		<p>
			If you cant find the YET extensions in YAKINDU SCT and if the the code generation for the tracer does not work 
			then you likely have to install the YET feature. 
			
			<ol>
				<li>Open <i>Help > Install New Software ...</i> from the menu.</li>
				<li>Select the Yakindu Labs entry from the <i>Work with:</i> pull down list. 
					If there is no such entry then
					<ol>
						<li>Choose <i>Add</i></li>
						<li>Enter <i>http://updates.yakindu.com/statecharts/labs</i> in the <i>Location</i> 
							field and optionally choose a name.</li>
						<li>Press <i>OK</i>.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Unfold the top level node and check the YET feature.</li>
				<li>Finish the installation wizard by choosing <i>Next ></i> until finished.</li>
				<li>Restart.</li>
			</ol>
