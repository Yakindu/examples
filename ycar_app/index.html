<h1>Webbased YCar App</h1>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>

<figure><img src="./img/tsdomain_hmimain.png"/></figure>

<p>This example demonstrates how a state machine can be generated as typescript artifact and how to integrate this into an angular 4 application.</p>

<p>In this example, we have a simple HMI that represents an infotainment system for cars.</p>

<p>This application consists of two screens: </p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>welcome screen</strong>: shows a welcome animation</li>
	<li><strong>main Screen</strong>: consist of severals components (speedometer, light widgets, infotainmentâ€¦).</li>
</ul>

<p>The infotainment component represents a container for further components like <em>infotainment menu</em>, <em>weather</em>, <em>music player</em> and <em>phone</em>. </p>

<h2>2. Set up the Development Environment</h2>

<p>You need to set up your development environment before you can run the angular application. </p>

<p>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" title="Node.js">Node.js and npm</a> if they are not already on your machine. </p>

<p>Verify that you are running at least node 6.9.x and npm 3.x.x by running <em>node -v</em> and <em>npm -v</em> in a terminal/console window. </p>

<p>Then install the <a href="Angular%20CLI" title="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli">Angular CLI</a> globally with <code>npm install -g @angular/cli</code>.</p>

<p>Open the <em>ycar_app</em> root folder in a terminal/console window and run <code>npm install</code>. By this command all project dependencies are installed.</p>

<h2>3. Run the YCar app</h2>

<p>In the terminal/console window run <code>npm start</code> . </p>

<p>With this command the application is bundled by webpack and a dev server is started. If the bundling process was successful you will see this messages in your terminal/console window: </p>

<figure><img src="./img/2017-05-08_14-09-23.png"/></figure>

<p>Open the url <em>http://localhost:4200</em> in a web browser. </p>

<p>You should see the <em>main screen</em> of the YCar App as follows: </p>

<h2>4. Behavior modeling with SCT Pro</h2>

<h3>4.1 ScreenService </h3>

<p>If you click the <strong>turn on</strong> button on the welcome screen, the welcome screen will disappear and the main screen will be displayed. </p>

<figure><img src="./img/ycar_anim1.gif"/></figure>

<p>This behavior was modeled as follows (<em>ycar_app/control/screenService.sct</em>): </p>

<figure><img src="./img/2017-05-08_15-44-13.png"/></figure>

<p>In the definition section two <strong>in events</strong> and two <strong>operation callbacks</strong> were defined. When the YCar application starts, the application enters the <em>off-state</em> and call the <em>navigateToWelcomeScreen</em> callback function. Thereby the welcome screen is shown. </p>

<p>If the <em>turn_on</em> button is clicked, the in-event <strong>onTurnOn</strong> will be raised and a state transition to state <strong>on</strong> occurs. By entering the on state, the operation callback <em>navigateToMainScreen</em> is called and the main screen appears. </p>

<h3>4.2 MenuService</h3>

<p>On the right side you see the menu with three items. If you click on an item, the correspond feature will be displayed. </p>

<figure><img src="./img/ycar_anim2.gif"/></figure>

<p>The behavior was modeled as follows (<em>ycar_app/control/menuService.sct</em>)</p>

<figure><img src="./img/2017-05-09_09-19-14.png"/></figure>

<p>In the definition section we defined a menuState <strong>variable</strong> of type string. The menuState is used to decide which state is to be entered. </p>

<p>Then we have defined an <em>in-event</em> <strong>onMenuChanged</strong> to respond to user interactions.</p>

<p>Finally, we have defined four <em>operation callbacks</em> which display the correspond feature. </p>

<h3>4.3 Generation of TypeScript artifacts </h3>

<p>Our goal is that the statechart is generated into the YCar project. </p>

<p>For configuring the code generation process, YAKINDU Statechart Tools uses a textual generator model called <strong>SGen</strong>. It can be created either by using the provided wizard <strong>YAKINDU Statechart Generator Model</strong> or by creating a new text file with the extension <strong>.sgen</strong>. </p>

<figure><img src="./img/2017-05-09_11-18-37.png"/></figure>

<p>The <strong>Outlet</strong> feature specifies target project and target folder for the generated artifacts. It is a <em>required</em> feature and has the following parameters: </p>

<ol>
	<li><em>targetProject</em> (String, required): The project to store the generated artifacts to.</li>
	<li><em>targetFolder</em> (String, required): The folder to store the generated artifacts to. If a library folder is given, only the dynamic (i.&nbsp;e. model-dependent artifacts) are generated into the target folder, if not all generated artifacts will be generated into it. All artifacts in this folder will be overwritten during re-generation.</li>
	<li><em>libraryTargetFolder</em> (String, optional): The folder to store the static (i.&nbsp;e. model-independent artifacts) to. In case this is not specified, all artifacts will be generated into the target folder. All artifacts in this folder will be preserved during re-generation.</li>
	<li><em>apiTargetFolder</em> (String, optional): The folder to store API code, e.g. interfaces or header files. In case this is not specified, all artifacts will be generated into the target folder.</li>
</ol>

<p>With the Outlet feature we specify that our target project is <strong>ycar_app</strong>. <br/>Our generated artifact should be generated into <strong>src/app/gen/statemachine</strong>.<br/>The generated state machines have some dependencies which are generated into the library target folder <strong>src/app/gen/stateutils</strong>.</p>

<p>With the <strong>GeneratorFeatures</strong> we specify that our statechart should be generated as angular service (<em>useAngular = true</em>) with an event driven (<em>useEventQueue = true</em>) behavior. </p>

<h3>4.4 Integrate the generated TypeScript - state machines into the YCar Application</h3>

<h4>4.4.1 ScreenService</h4>

<p>In context of angular, the generated ScreenService state machine was generated as Service. We need to add this service as provider into the <strong>ycar_app/src/app/app.module.ts</strong>:</p>

<figure><img src="./img/2017-05-09_12-39-11.png"/></figure>

<p>The service instance is injected into the <em>AppComponent</em> (ycar_app/src/app/ app.component.ts) by constructor injection (line 17). </p>

<figure><img src="./img/2017-05-09_13-24-56.png"/></figure>

<p>We need to write some glue code for setting the <em>in-events</em> and <em>operation callbacks</em>. We do that in the component lifecycle hook <em>ngAfterViewInit</em> (line 30 - 46).</p>

<p>In line 31 - 32 the screenService subscribes to the Observables <em>tunOff$</em> and <em>turnOn$</em>. </p>

<p>In line 34 - 41 we define an object from type <em>IOperationCallback</em>. The members of this Object are callback functions which are called from the screenService. </p>

<p>In line 43 the <em>operationCallback</em> object is passed as argument to <em>setdefaultScopeOperationCallback</em> function. </p>

<p>In line 44 - 45 we initialize and enter the screenService state machine. </p>

<h4>4.4.2 menuService </h4>

<p>The menuService need to be added as provider to <em> src/app/y-main-screen/y_main_screen.module.ts </em>.</p>

<figure><img src="./img/2017-05-09_13-51-02.png"/></figure>

<p>The instance of menuService is also injected like the screenService (line 24). </p>

<p>We need to customize <strong>YMainScreenComponent</strong> (<em>src/app/y-main-screen/y_main_screen.component.ts </em>) </p>

<figure><img src="./img/2017-05-09_14-20-57.png"/></figure>

<p>From line 34 to 47 we define the operation callback object from type <em>IOperationCallback</em>. The members of this object are callback functions which are called from the <em>menuService</em>. </p>

<p>In line 48 the <em>operationCallback</em> object is passes as argument to <em>setdefautScopeOperationCallback</em> function. </p>

<p>The <em>mainScreenService.menuChanged</em> observable is subscribed. Depending on the menuState value, the menuState from the menuService is set.</p>
