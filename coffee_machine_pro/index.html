		<h1>YAKINDU Coffee Machine pro example</h1>
		<p class="pro-feature">
			This is a comprehensive example for the deep integration of YAKINDU
			statecharts
			with manually written C code. The example is implemented
			as a simple
			command
			line tool. It makes use of POSIX threads. So you
			need a compiler tool
			chain and
			a 'pthread' library to build an run the
			example. The underlying
			statechart for the
			coffee machine looks as
			follows:

			<img alt="The digital watch statechart in all its details" src="images/CoffeeMachine_model.png" />

			The statechart consists of two major states "ON" and "OFF". The "ON"
			state is a composite
			state with several substates and substate
			machines for the different
			modes.
		</p>
		<h3>Manually written source code</h3>
		<p>
			The source code artifacts are all located in the 'src' folder. File
			names that include 'coffee' or 'cm_'
			include application specific
			implementations and those with 'sc_' prefix are
			generic parts that
			belong to the state machine infrastructure.
		</p>
		<h3>Set up your system</h3>
		<p>
			As mentioned above you need a compiler tool chain and the 'pthread'
			libraries.
			If you have a Linux or Mac OS Xsystem you likely have
			everything installed. If you run Windows than we propose to install
			cygwin tools (https://www.cygwin.com).</p>
		<h3>Set up the roject</h3>
		<p>
			This project is preconfigured for Windows with cygwin. If you use
			another system:
			<ul>
				<li>right-click on project 'coffee_machine' in the 'Project
					Explorer'</li>
				<li>choose 'Properties'	</li>
				<li>a dialog appears - choose 'C/C++ Build'</li>
				<li>select 'Tool Chain Editor'</li>
				<li>choose the appropriate tool chain for 'current tool chain'</li>
				<li>click 'OK'</li>
			</ul>
			... and your project should be ready to build.
		</p>
		<h3>Build</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Right-click on project 'coffee_machine' in the 'Project
					Explorer'</li>
				<li>choose 'Build Project'</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Run the example</h3>
		<p>
			In the 'Debug' or 'Release' folder you will find an executable
			'coffee_machine_pro.exe'
			(even on Linux and Mac OS X). Right-click on
			this and choose:
			<ul>
				<li>'Run As > Local C/C++ Application'.</li>
			</ul>
			The embedded Eclipse console shows up and you can follow the
			instructions. Enter
			'o' to start the coffee machine...

		</p>
		<h3>Simulate</h3>
		<p>
			Additionally you can simulate the statechart by right-click and
			choose:
			<ul>
				<li> 'Run As > Statechart Simulation'</li>
			</ul>
			You'll find more information
			on using the simulation in the
			<a
				href="https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/statechart-tools/documentation/user-guide/">help</a>
			.
		</p>
		<h3>Change the model</h3>
		<p>
			You may want to change or extend the model. Within the embedded
			expression editor
			you can press 'Ctrl-Space' to get proposals, which
			also include the C
			elements from
			the imported C header files.
			<img class="standard-image" src="images/CodeCompletion.png"
				alt="By pressing CTRL (CMD) +Space you get coding proposals." />
		</p>


		<h3>Generate state machine code</h3>
		<p>
			If you have changed the model you can generate state machine code by
			right-click on
			'CoffeeMachine.sgen' and choose 'Generate Code
			Artefacts'. This will generate:
			<ul>
				<li>CoffeeMachine.h </li>
				<li>CoffeeMachineRequired.h	</li>
				<li> CoffeeMachine.c </li>
			</ul>
