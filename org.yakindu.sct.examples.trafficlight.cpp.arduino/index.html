    <h1>Traffic Light (C++) for Arduino</h1>

    <p>Based on the standard traffic light example, this project shows how
      to use a statechart to develop software for the Arduino platform.</p>

    <p>
      <img class="large" alt="The statechart"
        src="images/TrafficLightCtrl.png" />
    </p>

    <p>More information about the statechart itself can be found in the
      standard traffic light example, which should be considered first. In
      summary, we have two traffic lights: one for the traffic on the street,
      and one for pedestrians who want to cross the street. They can push a
      button to request their traffic light to turn green, which activates a
      blinking wait-light first. The street's traffic light then goes through
      the standard procedure, turning on the yellow light, followed by the red
      light, allowing the pedestrians to cross safely. After some time, the
      pedestrians' traffic light turns red again, and the cars are allowed to
      pass until the next request is made by a pedestrian.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the traffic light can be switched off completely. This
      turns the yellow lights into a blinking mode, signaling that the traffic
      light is indeed switched off and that the street should be crossed in a
      careful manner.</p>

        <p>This video shows how the state machine runs on the example:</p>

      </p>

      <p>The correct pins can be found in the arduinoPins.h file.</p>
      <p>Get your parts ready! You will need:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>2 push buttons</li>
        <li>6 LEDs, ideally:
          <ul>
            <li>2x red</li>
            <li>2x green</li>
            <li>1x yellow</li>
            <li>1x white</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>8 resistors:
          <ul>
            <li>2x 10kR or similar</li>
            <li>6x 220R or similar</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Of course, you can change the pins, but since this represents the
        pin numbers in the software, don't forget to change them as well.</p>

          <h2>Addons for compiling and flashing</h2>
    <p>For compiling and flashing the Eclipse C++ IDE for Arduino plugin has been used. This can be found at 'https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-c-ide-arduino'. Please ensure that you have installed the Arduino toolchain. This can easily be done by installing the Arduino IDE, which can be found here: 'https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software'. It is not possible to compile code with the Eclipse C++ IDE for Arduino plugin without an installed toolchain!</p>
  	<h2>How to install the Eclipse C++ IDE for Arduino plugin</h2>
  	<p>
  	The easiest way is to use the example wizard. Required dependencies will be recoginized automatically and can be installed by clicking the "Install Dependencies.." button on the top right.
  	</p>
	<p>
	After the installation of the plugin: Ensure that you have downloaded the 'Arduino AVR Boards'. You need to add them via 'Help' -> 'Arduino Downloads Manager' -> 'Platforms' -> 'Add'
	</p>
    </div>
    
        <h2>Using the Eclipse C++ IDE for Arduino plugin</h2>
    After the installation you should notice a new toolbar, which allows you to compile and flash your Arduino.
    <ol>
      <li>First of all, your project should contain no errors any more.</li>
      <li>To get started you need to configure the desired platform. Choose your personal settings and board. Most of the Arduinos (Uno, Mega, etc.) should be supported. Plug in your Arduino and click on 'New Launch Target..'.</li>
      <li>Set up your device. This depends on your system and configuration.</li>
	  <li>Build project.</li>
      <li>Upload the example.</li>
	  <li>The trafficlight should start blinking now!</li>
